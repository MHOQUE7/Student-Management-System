# Summary

The Student Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the organization of student records, advisor assignments, and course enrollments. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP), a modular design, and linked lists to manage data efficiently. With its interactive menu-driven interface, users can easily add, edit, and display detailed information about students, advisors, and courses. This project demonstrates Python programming, OOP principles, and the practical use of data structures.
